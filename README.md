# Ito Process Book

Numerical implementations of common processes in Stochastic Analysis. Mostly for educational/illustrative purposes but planning to expand into a library for equities/IR models.

## Contents So Far
- [Wiener Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process)
- [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)
- [Brownian Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_bridge)
- Maximum Process

## Planning to Add
- Jump Processes
- Hitting Times processes
- More Stochastic Volatility Models (e.g., SABR & Heston)
- Brownian Motion on a Circle
- Bessel Process
