# ito-process-book
Numerical implementations of common processes in Stochastic Analysis. Mostly for educational / illustrative purposes but also functions as a library for equities / IR models.

Contents  so far:
-Wiener Process (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process)
-Geometric Brownian Motion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion)
-Brownian Bridge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_bridge)
-Brownian Motion on a circle
-Bessel Process
-Maximum Process
-Hitting time process
-Poisson Process

Planning to add:
-Jump processes
-More Stochastic Volatility models such as SABR & Heston
